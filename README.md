Inside, the RAV4 prioritizes ergonomics and cubby storage. A useful shelf spans the dash and complements the large center console. The version we tested featured a mix of soft-touch surfaces and nice plastics. The base trim, called LE, is quite spartan and comes with cloth seats, a plasticky steering wheel, and single-zone manual climate control. On the next-step-up XLE, Toyota throws in a few perks, but there's much more to like on the XLE Premium, including faux-leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and a stitched and padded dashboard and center-console armrest. The RAV4's rear seats are easy to stow, and they fold to a nearly flat position, opening up the cabin https://tonaton.ug for cargo. We fit 10 of our carry-on suitcases behind the rear seat and 22 with it folded. The Nissan Rogue matched the RAV4 here, but the Subaru Forester beat it by one in each metric.
